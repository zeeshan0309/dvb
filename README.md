## Python implementation
- 64-point DIF (Decimation In Frequency) FFT implementation from Scratch
- tested against Numpy module's inbuilt FFT function, results were comfortably within expectations

## Verilog implementation
- 8-point DIF (Decimation In Frequency) FFT implementation from Scratch
- tested against Numpy module's inbuilt FFT function, results were comfortably within expectations
